Configuration Usage
===================

Introduction
------------

The vital ``config_block`` supports general configuration tasks where
a general purpose key/value pair is needed. The configuration block is
used to specify, communicate and set configurable items in many
different situations. The two major users of the configuration support
are algorithms and processes. In addition, there are a few other
places that they are used also.

Configurations are usually established in an external file which are
read and converted to an internal ``config_block`` object. This is the
typical way to control the behaviour of the software. Configuration
blocks can also be created pragmatically such as when specifying an
expected set of configurable items.

When algorithms are used within processes, the configuration entries
are specified as a block in the pipe file. The process takes the
appropriate config subblock and passes it to the
``set_nested_algo_configuration()`` method to instantiate and
configure the algorithm.


From File to config_block
-------------------------

Using config_block_io to directly convert config file into block. This
can be used by a main program that manages configs and algorithms
directly. The ``read_config_file()`` uses a complex set of rules to
locate config files based on host system and application name.

Establishing Expected Config
----------------------------

The expected configuration is established using macros. The general form for
the PLUGGALBE_IMPL() macro which sets configuration parameters is shown below.

.. code-block:: c++

  PLUGGABLE_IMPL(
    <class name>,
    <description>,
    <list of PARAM/PARAM_DEFAULT macros>)

An example configuration for the ``filter_tracks`` algorithm is shown below.

.. code-block:: c++

  class KWIVER_ALGO_CORE_EXPORT filter_tracks
    : public vital::algo::filter_tracks
  {
  public:
    PLUGGABLE_IMPL(
      filter_tracks,
      "Filter tracks by track length or matrix matrix importance.",
      PARAM_DEFAULT(
        min_track_length, unsigned int,
        "Filter the tracks keeping those covering "
        "at least this many frames. Set to 0 to disable.",
        3 ),
      PARAM_DEFAULT(
        min_mm_importance, double,
        "Filter the tracks with match matrix importance score "
        "below this threshold. Set to 0 to disable.",
        1.0 )
    )

Once an algorithm has been created, the configuration parameters can be modified
or set using the ``->set_value()`` method. The following example shows how to
modify the configuration values in the ``filter_features_scale`` algorithm.

.. code-block:: c++

  plugin_manager::instance().load_all_plugins();

    // Generate instance of the filter_tracks algorithm
    algo::filter_tracks_sptr filter_algo =
      create_algorithm< algo::filter_tracks >( "core" );

    // Get the configuration of the filter_tracks algorithm
    config_block_sptr config = filter_algo->get_configuration();

    // Adjust configuration parameter values to filter 3 features
    // and set ``top_fraction`` to 0.3
    config->set_value( "min_track_length", 5 );
    config->set_value( "min_mm_importance", 0.8 );

    // Set the updated configuration to the filter algorithm
    filter_algo->set_configuration( config );

This expected configuration serves as documentation for the algorithm
or process configuration items when it is displayed by other tools.
It is also used to validate the configuration supplied at run time to make
sure all expected items are present.


Usage by Algorithms
'''''''''''''''''''

Algorithms specify their expected set of configurable items using the
``PLUGGALBE_IMPL()`` macro as described above.  This macro then defines the
``get_configuration()`` and ``set_configuration()`` methods.

The run time configuration is passed to an algorithm through the
``set_configuration()`` method. This method typically extracts the
expected configuration values and saves them locally for the algorithm
to use. When a configuration is read from the file, there is no
guarantee that all expected configuration items are present and
attempting to get a value that is not present generates an exception.

The recommended way to avoid this problem is to use the expected
configuration, as created by the macro, then supply any missing entries using
the ``set_configuration_internal()`` method. The following code snippet shows
how this is done.

.. code-block:: c++

    // Set this algorithm's properties via a config block
    void
    <algorithm>
    ::set_configuration_internal( vital::config_block_sptr in_config )
    {

      // Starting with our generated vital::config_block to ensure that assumed values are present
      // An alternative is to check for key presence before performing a get_value() call.
      vital::config_block_sptr const& config = this->get_configuration();

      // Merge in supplied config to cause these values to overwrite the defaults.
      config->merge_config( in_config );
    }


Instantiating Algorithms
''''''''''''''''''''''''

Algorithms can be used directly in application code. The actual implementation
of the abstract algorithm interface is specified through a config block.

Lets first look at the code that will instantiate the configured
algorithm and then look at the contents of the configuration file.

The following code snippet instantiates a ``draw_detected_object_set``
algorithm.

.. code-block:: c++

  // this pointer will be used to reference the algorithm after it is created.
  vital::algo::draw_detected_object_set_sptr m_algo;

  // Get algorithm configuration
  auto algo_config = get_config(); // or an equivalent call

  // Check config so it will give run-time diagnostic of config problems
  if ( ! vital::algo::draw_detected_object_set::check_nested_algo_configuration( "draw_algo", algo_config ) )
  {
    LOG_ERROR( logger, "Configuration check failed." );
  }

  vital::algo::draw_detected_object_set::set_nested_algo_configuration( "draw_algo", algo_config, m_algo );
  if ( ! d->m_algo )
  {
    LOG_ERROR( logger, "Unable to create algorithm." );
  }

After the configuration is extracted, it is passed to the
``check_nested_algo_configuration()`` method to determine if the
configuration has the basic ``type`` entry and the requested type is
available. If the ``type`` entry is missing or the specified
implementation is not available, a detailed log message is generated
with the available implementations.

If the configuration is acceptable, the
``set_nested_algo_configuration()`` call will actually instantiate and
configure the selected algorithm implementation.

The name that is supplied to these calls, "draw_algo" in this case, is
used access the configuration block for this algorithm.

The following configuration file snippet can be used to configure
the above algorithm.::

  block draw_algo
    type = ocv    # select the ocv instance of this algorithm

    block ocv     # configure the 'ocv' instance
      alpha_blend_prob   = true
      default_line_thickness   = 1.25
      draw_text   = false
    endblock # for ocv
  endblock  # for draw_algo

The outer block labeled "draw_algo" specifies the configuration to be
used for the above code snippet. The config entry "type" specifies
which implementation of the algorithm to instantiate. The following
block labeled "ocv" is used to configure the algorithm after it is
instantiated. The block labeled "ocv" is used for algorithm type
"ocv". If the algorithm type was "foo", then the block "foo" would be
used to configure the algorithm.


Verifying a Configuration
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

When a configuration file (or configuration section of a pipe file) is
read in, there is no checking of the configuration key names. There is
no way of knowing which configuration items are valid or expected and
which ones are not. If a name is misspelled, which sometimes happens,
it will be misspelled in the configuration block. This can lead to
hours of frustration diagnosing a problem.

A configuration can be checked against a baseline using the
config_difference class. This class provides methods to determine the
differences between a reference configuration and one created from an
input file. The difference between these two configurations is
presented in two different ways. It provides a list of keys that are
baseline config and not in the supplied config. These are the config
items that were expected but not supplied. It also provides a list of
keys that are in the supplied config but not in the expected
config. These items are supplied but not expected.

The following code snippet shows how to report the difference between
two config blocks.

.. code-block:: c++

  //                                    ref-config                received-config
  kwiver::vital::config_difference cd( this->get_configuration(), config );
  const auto key_list = cd.extra_keys();
  if ( ! key_list.empty() )
  {
    // This may be considered an error in some cases
    LOG_WARN( logger(), "Additional parameters found in config block that are not required or desired: "
              << kwiver::vital::join( key_list, ", " ) );
  }

  key_list = cd.unspecified_keys();
  if ( ! key_list.empty() )
  {
    LOG_WARN( logger(), "Parameters that were not supplied in the config, using default values: "
              << kwiver::vital::join( key_list, ", " ) );
  }


Not all applications need to check both cases. There may be good
reasons for not specifying all expected configuration items when the
default values are as expected. In some cases, unexpected items that
are supplied by the configuration may be indications of misspelled
entries.


Config Management Techniques
----------------------------

The configuration file reader provides several alternatives for
managing the complexity of a large configuration. The block / endblock
construct can be used to shorten config lines and modularize the
configuration. The include directove can be used to share or reuse
portions of a config.

Starting with the example config section that selects an algorithm and
configures it::

    algorithm_instance_name:type = type_name
    algorithm_instance_name:type_name:algo_param = value
    algorithm_instance_name:type_name:threshold = 234

The block construct can be used to simplify the configuration and
make it easier to navigate.::

  block algorithm_instance_name
    type = type_name
    block  type_name
      algo_param = value
      threshold = 234
    endblock
  endblock

In cases where the configuration block is extensive or used in
multiple applications, that part of the configuration can exist as a
stand-alone file and be included where it is needed.::

    block  algorithm_instance_name
      include type_name.conf
    endblock

where ``type_name.conf`` contains::

    type = type_name
    block   type_name
      algo_param = value
      threshold = 234
    endblock

Environment variables and config macros can be combined to provide a
level of adaptability to config files. Using the environment macro in
an include directive can provide run time agility without requiring
the file to be edited. The following is an example of selecting a
different include file based on mode.::

  include $ENV{MODE}/config.file.conf


Using enums in config entries
-----------------------------

Quite often a configuration parameter can only take a fixed number of
values such as when the user is trying to configure an enum. The enum
support in vital directly supports converting strings to enum values
with the use of the ``enum_converter`` and enum support in the config
block. The enum converter will verify that the supplied string
represents an enum value, and throw an error if it does not. The list
of valid enum strings is provided to assist in documenting config
entries.

The following code snippets show examples on how to use
the ``ENUM_CONVERTER`` macro.::

   #include <vital/util/enum_converter.h>

  ENUM_CONVERTER(
    method_converter, inpainting_method, { "mask", METHOD_mask },
    { "navier_stokes", METHOD_navier_stokes } )

  ENUM_CONVERTER(
    morphology_converter, morphology_mode,
    { "erode", MORPHOLOGY_erode }, { "dilate", MORPHOLOGY_dilate },
    { "open", MORPHOLOGY_open }, { "close", MORPHOLOGY_close },
    { "none", MORPHOLOGY_none } );
