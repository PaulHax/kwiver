/// Combines a feature matchers, homography estimation, and filtering
///
///  This is a meta-algorithm for feature matching that combines one or more
///  other feature matchers with homography estimation and feature filtering.
///  The algorithm applies another configurable feature matcher algorithm and
///  then applies a homography estimation algorithm to the resulting matches.
///  Outliers to the fit homography are discarded from the set of matches.
///
///  If a second matcher algorithm is provided, this algorithm will warp the
///  feature locations by the estimated homography before applying the second
///  matching algorithm to the aligned points.  This approach is useful for
///  finding weak matches that were missed by the first matcher but are
///  easier to detect once approximate location is known.  A good choice for
///  the second matcher is vxl::match_features_constrained.
///
///  If a filter_features algorithm is provided, this will be run on the
///  input features \b before running the first matcher.  The second matcher
///  will then run on the \b original unfilter features.  This allows, for
///  example, a slower but more robust feature matcher to run on a subset
///  of the strongest feature points in order to quickly establish an
///  and estimated homography.  Then a second, fast matcher can pick up
///  the additional weak matches using the constraint that the location
///  in the image is now known approximately.
