/// @brief Generate bounding boxes from a heat map.
///
/// This object detector algorithm implementation extracts a detected object set
/// from a heat map image. There are a number of different modes of operation.
/// If
/// "threshold" is set to a positive value, the heat map is first thresholded to
/// a binary image, and the detected objects correspond to bounding boxes around
/// clusters of connected pixels. These detected objects can further be filtered
/// based on the cluster region properties (e.g., area, fill fraction, etc.).
/// If threshold is set to -1, the heat map will be processed using the full
/// pixel-value range.
///
/// If a threshold is provided and force_bbox_width and force_bbox_height are
/// not
/// set, then the thresholded binary image will be clustered into connected-
/// component regions, each becoming a detection with a bounding box.
///
/// If force_bbox_width and force_bbox_height are set, a greedy algorithm will
/// attempt to put down bounding boxes of fixed size. The first bounding box is
/// chosen to cover the greatest sum-intensity in the heat map. This region is
/// masked out, and the next bounding box tries to captures the maximum
/// remaining
/// intensity, and this process is repeated. The end result is not necassarily a
/// global optimum, as map cover problems are np hard.
