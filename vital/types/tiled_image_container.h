/// Container for an image segmented into a regular grid of tiles.
///
/// This class holds a grid of sub-images (tiles) aligned to a grid, which
/// together form the full image. The full image may be sparse, i.e. any
/// particular location in the grid may contain no pixel data. All tiles must
/// have the same dimensions and pixel format.
///
/// This class is intended to allow handling of very large images by not
/// necessarily requiring all image data to be loaded into memory at once, or
/// indeed to exist at all. The image is accessed on a tile-by-tile basis,
/// allowing implementations to load images piecemeal from disk, over the
/// network, or on-demand from some other image construction method.
///
/// As the most common use case for \c tiled_image_container is to hold images
/// too large to fit into memory all at once, the \c get_image() function of any
/// implementation classes may return an empty image (with appropriate pixel
/// traits set, but no pixel data).
